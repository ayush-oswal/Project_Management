# üöÄ Project Management Website

This project is a business-to-business (B2B) website tailored for project management. It facilitates two main user cases: administrators and employees. Administrators have the ability to manage clients, employees, and projects. Projects assigned to employees are displayed on their respective dashboards. The website is fully responsive and features a search functionality for projects. Additionally, users can add comments to track progress on projects. Administrators can set the status of projects to "Not Started" (red), "In Progress" (yellow), or "Completed" (green). On the dashboard, projects are organized according to their status.
